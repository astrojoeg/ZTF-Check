Quickly query the ZTF and Pan-STARRS (PS1) databases for quick reference images, the latter of which is multicolor. All you need is your target's R.A. and decl.!

ZTF Imager is especially useful when checking to see if you target has an extremely close neighbor or neighboring bright star that could be contaminating it's ZTF light curves.

To run ZTF Imager, operate the following terminal command:
```$ ztfimager -ra <ra in degrees> -dec <dec in degrees>```
